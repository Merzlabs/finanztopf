# Security Policy

> This is side project. We only work on it on my free time. We try to do our best to keep this project working securely but we cannot guarantee any stability and security fixes. Please consider the steps below before publishing security related bugs.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you encounter any security related issues please contact me via the e-mail from my [Github](https://github.com/niklasmerz) profile before publishing it. Just hit me up that you have found a bug. You should use PGP if you want to send sensible information to me but I would prefer to use the Github tools. I will add you to the private discussion to go into detail. 

I will create a new security advisory as soon as possible. Security advisories allow us to discuss the issue privatly and work on a solution before releasing any details.

Keybase is another secure channel: https://keybase.io/niklasmerz
